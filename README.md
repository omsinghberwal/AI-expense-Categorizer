# AI-Powered Expense Categorizer

This project processes financial transactions and categorizes expenses using machine learning.

## Features
- Categorizes expenses based on transaction descriptions.
- Automatically uses a sample CSV file (`sample_transactions.csv`) if no input is provided.
- Trains and saves a model for repeated use.
- Generates visualizations of expense distribution.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, joblib

## How to Use
1. Ensure `sample_transactions.csv` is in the same directory as the program files.
2. Run `main.py` to start the application.
3. Provide your training data (if needed) or use the pre-trained model.
4. View categorized expenses in `categorized_expenses.csv`.
5. Check the generated chart (`expense_distribution.png`) for visualization.

Enjoy!
